Rh was written by Ken Stauffer to make the job of finding files easier by
allowing the user to enter real C expressions. This notation is much
easier to master than the notation used by the find(1) command, because
most Unix users already know C. In addition to being easier to use than
find(1), rh expressions can be used to select the desired files.

This version provides a fairly powerful mini-language for writing search
predicates in.  It's not unlike the "tw" file walker presented at the
Baltimore 89 Usenix.
